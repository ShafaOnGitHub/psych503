Assignment 2



Print Exercise:
1). created file Shafa.py
2). No, I havent created any varibles yet, so the script is just running the print comand without creating varibles. 

Operation Exersice: 
1)Both the integer divsion and the float division give the same output, but this might be due to my version of python. 
2)The modulo operator give you the remainder from a dividing the first number by the second. 
3)** is the oporation for an exponent, while // is the opposite of modulo in that it give how many times the first number is divisible by the second. 
4)Yes python follows order of oporations (BEDMAS)

Variable Exercise: 
1). completed 
2). yes, each letter creates a string variable
3). NA
4). No problem, it seems python is able to store the same value as different varibles. 
5). No changing the value of x only changed that varible, and not the other ones. 
6). No change to letter letterx. This means that variables are created and modified in the order that the code appears. Variables assignment works independently of one another 

Boolean Exercise: 
1). 1 is equal to 1.0, but "1" is not equal to "1.0" This is because without the parentheses, they are considered numbers, were 1 and 1.0 are equal, but with parentheses, they are considered string objects, like a character. 
2). Yes 
3). print (1 == 1.0 and not "1" == "1.0" and 5 ==(3+2) )
print (1 == 1.0 or 5 == (3+2) and not "1" == "1.0" )
print (5 == (3+2) and 1 == 1.0 and not "1" == "1.0")
print (5 == (3+2) or 1 == 1.0 and not "1" == "1.0")
print (5 == (3+2) and not "1" == "1.0" and 1 == 1.0)

List Exercise: 
1). Yes it became a variable
2). See line 47
3). It says its length is 5
4). It says its a list 
5). See line 51
6). Yes, see line 52

Dictionary Exercise: 
1). See line 55
2). See line 56
3). The length is 4. Python determins the length of a dictionary by the number of subject entries (text labels). 

Array Exercise: 
1). It printed the all numbers as floats (with a decimal point) 
2). The entire array is printed as strings. Python understands variables in a mixed type array as string variables.  
3). See line 71
4). See line 74
