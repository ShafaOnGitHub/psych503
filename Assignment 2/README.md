Print Exercise:
1). created file Shafa.py
2). No, I havent created any varibles yet, so the script is just running the print comand without creating varibles. 

Operation Exersice: 
1)Both the integer divsion and the float division give the same output, but this might be due to my version of python. 
2)The modulo operator give you the remainder from a dividing the first number by the second. 
3)** is the oporation for an exponent, while // is the opposite of modulo in that it give how many times the first number is divisible by the second. 
4)Yes python follows order of oporations (BEDMAS)

Variable Exercise:

2). yes, each letter creates a string variable
3). NA
