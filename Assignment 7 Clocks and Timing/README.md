# Clocks exercise

1. I get and image presentation time of 2.005430332996184. So it is not exactly 2 seconds. It is not very presise 

2. This timer is quite a bit more presise with a the wait timer, but it's undershooting the time.  

3. With the ccountdown timer, it is still undershooting the time we have said. So still it is not exactly precise. 

4. See .py file 


# Frame based Timing exercise 

1. see .py file 

2. less than 20 frames per second are dropped for my experiment, so I will keep it as is.
